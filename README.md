# ov_prognosis_prediction
Assessing the clinical utility of multi-omics data for predicting serous ovarian cancer prognosis
There are three parts of code.
Part1: prognosis prediction for survival model;
Part2: prognosis prediction for treatment outcome model;
Part3: pathway analyses.

For part1, there are four folders (DNA-seq, RNA-seq, miRNA-seq, DNA-methylation) that are all written by R (containing two steps);
For part2, there are four folders (DNA-seq, RNA-seq, miRNA-seq, DNA-methylation) that are written by R and Python (containing two steps);
For part3, there is a single file written by R.

Data files including "tcga.RNAseq.csv", "tgca.DNAmethylation.txt" cannot be uploaded because their size
